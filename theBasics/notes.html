<!-- WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT -->
javascript is a lightweight(doesnt take up too much space), cross-platform (works on many platforms) object oriented programming language. It is one of the core technologies of web development.
Thanks to node .js develoeprs can now use javascript on the server side as well. It allows us to not only add dynamic effects but also complex modern web apps that we can interact with.

HTML - responsible for content
CSS - for presentation
JAVASCRIPT - for dynamic effects and real programming capabilities
